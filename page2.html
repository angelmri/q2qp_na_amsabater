            <p>At MCP we have been undertaking weekly beach and dive clean up work since 2015. However, cleaning our beaches alone is not going to solve the problem so in August 2017 we launched a specific project focused on marine plastics. Through an intense data collection exercise and a sample of local beaches, we identified a wide range of initiatives that we would like to peruse to tackle the issue of marine plastics. We are currently focused on:
                <ul>
                    <li>working with the local municipality to implement a ‘plastic bag free market’ policy to be piloted at Negros Oriental’s largest ‘geto’ market – Malatapay Market;</li>
                    <li>working with local Barangays and the Municipality to improve local solid waste management;</li>
                    <li>replacing the current styrofoam buoys used to mark marine protect areas with more sustainable and heard wearing options.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The Philippines, sitting in the coral triangle, is home to a vast array of marine life, all of which in one way or another is struggling to survive a number human pressures. At a national level we are seeing broad declines in fish biomass and biodiversity and an ever-increasing rate of bleaching and disease. The piling up of pressures makes it hard for ecosystems to overcome any one pressure, we are repressing nature’s immune system as it were. The wide spread pressures are climate change, ocean acidification, nutrient pollution, and overfishing.
            To begin to solve and mitigate the impact of these stressors we need to take a broad approach, understanding the nature of environmental stress and where best to act. Doing so, involves a broad scope, focussing not just on observing the environment but also acting upon information and working with those who can create sustainable movements for conservation.</p>

            <p>Partnered with Pro Ocean on collection and recycling marine debris and ocean plastics.   Collected (Jan – October) approximately 3.000.000 pieces of plastic garbage (~60 tonnes). We were able to recycle ~43% (by weight) and properly dispose of the rest.</p>
