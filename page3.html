        <p>The world around us is changing and marine ecosystems are in more peril than ever before. Realizing this urgency, we bring people with diverse backgrounds and skills together to build financial, social and scientific capacity to respond to unprecedented threats to food security, societal stability and ocean health.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>We believe it is our collective responsibility to act and affect meaningful change, and that it is only through the choices we make and in how we influence others that we can ensure the world we are building will continue to include thriving and life-supporting marine ecosystems.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>To realize this vision we will tirelessly work to educate the public and influential decision makers to recognize the immeasurable value of the marine ecosystem, vastly improving the societal and natural environment of the Philippines, now and in the future.</p>

        <p>As a volunteer at Marine Conservation Philippines, you’ll experience both the splendor of the seas and witness shortsighted wanton destruction of coral reefs. You’ll learn through scientific diving why the protection of the seas is of paramount importance to a myriad of ecosystems, and through your very real contribution to our efforts, you’ll help affect change. Most importantly, when you eventually leave us, you too will become an ambassador of change.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="donation">
        <img src="media/donations.jpg" alt="">
        <p>With the help of volunteers and kind donors we achieve results and make a difference. Through your donation you will empower us to continue our fight for sustainability and healthier seas; to remove plastics from the sea; to plant mangroves and to building livelihoods for marginalised fisherfolk.</p>

    <div id="diving-course">
        <img src="media/my-grades.jpg" alt="">
        <p>We offer many courses that you can participate in during your stay with us. We allow participating volunteers to do one scuba course for each started four week segment they are with us.  However, if you are already a certified diver and prefer to jump straight into the conservation work, that’s great! After a day or two of “diver bootcamp,” you can begin your scientific diver survey training.</p>
